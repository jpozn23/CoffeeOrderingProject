# Coffee Ordering Mobile App
## Project Description
Campus Coffee Shops are often faced with an excessive amount of orders between classes as students are trying to order a drink in the limited time they have. If a system existed that allowed users to pre order coffee from the shops, worker stress and student wait time would be greatly reduced leading to a more sufficient ordering process.
